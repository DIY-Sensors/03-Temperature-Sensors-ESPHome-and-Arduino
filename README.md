  <h1>Temperature and Humidity Sensor Comparison</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to the GitHub repository for our video comparing indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity sensors! In this project, we dive deep into the world of climate monitoring, exploring the performance of three popular indoor sensors (DHT22, HTU21d, and BME680) alongside an outdoor Dallas sensor.</p>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  
  <p>In this project, we provide a comprehensive comparison of different temperature and humidity sensors commonly used for indoor and outdoor monitoring. We demonstrate how to connect each sensor to a WEMOS Mini D1 board and display their readings simultaneously in Home Assistant.</p>
  
  <h2>Contents</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Code:</strong> Find the code for each sensor in both ESPHome and Arduino in the respective folders.</li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> Raw data collected during the sensor comparison tests.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Additional documentation, including wiring diagrams and setup instructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Video:</strong> Link to the YouTube video showcasing the sensor comparison and code tutorials.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  
  <p>Feel free to explore the code provided for each sensor and adapt it to your own projects. Make sure to follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation for proper wiring and configuration.</p>

  
  <p>Check out the test setup in action:</p>
